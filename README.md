## Overview
TaskTrek is a simple terminal-based task scheduling and prioritization system implemented in C. It uses a priority queue to manage and organize tasks by importance, and includes support for file-based saving and loading of tasks.

## Features:
âœ… Add tasks with a priority  <br>
ðŸ§  Automatically handles priority-based ordering  <br>
ðŸ”„ Execute (remove) the highest priority task  <br>
ðŸ“‹ Display all current tasks  <br>
ðŸ’¾ Save tasks to a file  <br>
ðŸ“‚ Load tasks from a file  <br>
ðŸ§¹ Priority 1 tasks are treated as most urgent and handled separately  

## Compilation:
To compile the program, use gcc:

```bash
gcc tasktrek.c -o tasktrek
```

## Usage:
Run the program using:

```bash
./tasktrek
```

## Menu Options:
- **Add a task** â€“ Input task name and priority (lower number = higher priority).  
- **Task to be done** â€“ Removes and displays the highest-priority task.  
- **Display all tasks** â€“ Shows the full to-do list with priorities.  
- **Save tasks to file** â€“ Saves current tasks to a file named `tasks`.  
- **Load tasks from file** â€“ Loads tasks from the `tasks` file.  
- **Exit** â€“ Quits the program.  

## Task Priority Rules:
- Priority 1 is considered most urgent and always moved to the front of the queue.  
- Other tasks follow a max-heap behavior (higher number = higher priority).  

## File Format:
Tasks are saved in the `tasks` file in the following format:
```
TaskName1 2  
TaskName2 1  
```

Each line contains a task name and its priority, separated by a space.

## Example:
```

Created as a simple C project for practicing file handling, priority queues, and menu-driven interfaces.
