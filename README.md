## Overview
TaskTrek is a simple terminal-based task scheduling and prioritization system implemented in C. It uses a priority queue to manage and organize tasks by importance, and includes support for file-based saving and loading of tasks.

## Features:
- âœ… Add tasks with a priority
- ðŸ§  Automatically handles priority-based ordering
- ðŸ”„ Execute (remove) the highest priority task
- ðŸ“‹ Display all current tasks
- ðŸ’¾ Save tasks to a file
- ðŸ“‚ Load tasks from a file
- ðŸ§¹ Priority 1 tasks are treated as most urgent and handled separately

## Compilation:
To compile the program, use gcc:  
```bash
gcc tasktrek.c -o tasktrek

## Usage:
Run the program using:
  ./tasktrek

## Menu Options:
Add a task â€“ Input task name and priority (lower number = higher priority).
Task to be done â€“ Removes and displays the highest-priority task.
Display all tasks â€“ Shows the full to-do list with priorities.
Save tasks to file â€“ Saves current tasks to a file named tasks.
Load tasks from file â€“ Loads tasks from the tasks file.
Exit â€“ Quits the program.

## Task Priority Rules:
Priority 1 is considered most urgent and always moved to the front of the queue.
Other tasks follow a max-heap behavior (higher number = higher priority).

## File Format:
Tasks are saved in the tasks file in the following format:
  TaskName1 2
  TaskName2 1
  ...
  
Each line contains a task name and its priority, separated by a space.
